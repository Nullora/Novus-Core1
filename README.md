# Novus-Core1
A cool 24bit cpu made in Logisim.
# Installation
- Just clone the repo with "git repo https://github.com/Nullora/Novus-Core1" and open the .circ file with Logisim.
- Instruction set found at "inst.md". Program some cool stuff and send it to me, I'd love to check it out!
# Usage
- Load your program into ram.
- Turn on inputs "TURN_ON" "EnableClock" "UNLOCK" to start running program.
- "RESET" to reset memory + counter.
- "MAN" for manual clock ticks.
# Why I made this
Making this cpu helped me understand how instructions flow, how data moves, and how a computer “thinks.”
If you’re curious about hardware, this is a great playground! Edit and use it however you please.

# Warning
- This was made in Logisim 4.0.0 and only tested on that version, I don't know how it will perform on other versions.
- Load the file "24bit instruction set" into rom if not already loaded, otherwise nothing will work.
- "Jump if not equal" command might not work, I haven't honestly tested it.
